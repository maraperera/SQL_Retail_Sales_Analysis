# SQL Retail Sales Analysis
This project is an end-to-end analysis of retail sales data using SQL to answer key business questions. The process included setting up a database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and writing complex queries to extract actionable insights on sales performance and customer trends. It demonstrates core data analysis skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical querying within a SQL environment.

# Data Exploration & Cleaning
This initial phase focuses on data exploration and cleaning to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. The first step was to profile the data to understand its basic dimensions, including counting the total number of sales records, determining the number of unique customers, and listing all distinct product categories.

Following this exploration, a query was run to check for data integrity by identifying any rows with missing values in critical columns. Since these incomplete records could skew the analysis, they were subsequently removed from the table to maintain data quality for the upcoming analysis.
